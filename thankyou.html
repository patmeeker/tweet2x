This is a photo of me and my girlfriend, Aiyi. We hope you enjoy Tweet2X. If you'd like to support this project by donating, we'd both like to sincerely thank you. We aren't a big software company or anything - we're just two people. So even the small donations we get really make a difference. I made Tweet2X for fun, so I'm thrilled that I can afford to continue improving and updating it thanks to you. Warm regards!</h3></p></div></div></a>
